### Hello!
## I'm Matthew

For as long as I can remember, I've always enjoyed technology. Affectionaly, I have been given the nickname "IT specialist" by freinds and family. From something as simple as restarting the router to a multiday google search rabbit hole, I'm seemingly the go to person for any technology issues. I genuinely enjoy the process of understanding a problem, finding multiple solutions, and ultimently applying the correct one. With all that being said, I didn't go down the IT track, instead chosing Comptuer Science. My decision for this was two fold. First and formost, I found that Computer Science allowed me the freedom to explore a wide range of disaplices and professions. I like to say my hobby is finding new hobbies and I wanted a degree that reflected my desire to explore my ever increasing list of interests. The second reason for becoming a Computer Science was due to a group of highscool teachers whom I had a lot of respect for. They all suggested I continure down the engineering path with one in particular pushing me towards CS. Looking back, I'm certainly glad they did!

My hope is for this website is to give somebody a good idea of the types of interests and experences I have obtained through work, school, or personal projects. Thank you for taking the time to read this indrodcuton! Please reach out to me if you have any questions about my work.
